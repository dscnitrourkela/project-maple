# APTICHE TECHNICAL GUIDE

AptiChe is an initiative by the **AIChE NITR student chapter in association with Google Developers Students Club, NITR** to provide an opportunity to the students to practice and showcase their aptitude and reasoning skills.
This project uses the [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for State Management and Local Storage, [Firebase](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_auth) for authentication and [GraphQL](https://pub.dev/packages/graphql_flutter) for the GraphQL Client.

## Installation Guide

1. **Install Flutter on your machine**

    Install flutter by selecting the operating system on which you are installing Flutter: [Flutter installation tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

    To check if you have flutter installed along wtih proper necesarry SDKs installed
    run `flutter doctor`

2. **Fork and Clone the Repo**

    Fork the repo by clicking on the **Fork** button on the top right corner of the page.
    To clone this repository, run `git clone https://github.com/dscnitrourkela/project-maple.git`
    Then run `cd project-maple`

3. **Get Packages**

     Make sure you are in the `project-maple/aptiche` directory

    - From the terminal: Run `flutter pub get`.

      _OR_
    - From Android Studio/IntelliJ: **Click Packages get** in the action ribbon at the top of `pubspec.yaml`.

```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

``` markdown
lib/
|- datamodels/
|- services/
|- utils/
|- views/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

``` markdown
